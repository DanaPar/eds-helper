Pet project for learning purposes and for helping with filling in tax declarations.

I'm storing info about received dividends in database. When filling in declaration, I have to find exchange rate on Bank.lv for every transaction which happened in foreign currency on given date and calculate it to local currency (EUR). It's time-consuming and annoying, that's why I decided to make this tool. <br>
It gets data about received dividends from database and searches currency exchange rates automatically based on stored information in database.
